LIFESTYLE CONNECT - TABLET USER GUIDE
================================================================================

If you're using a TABLET (iPad, Android tablet, etc.), you have a few options:

================================================================================
OPTION 1: USE A COMPUTER/LAPTOP (RECOMMENDED)
================================================================================

The EASIEST option is to use a computer or laptop to:
1. Download the project files
2. Set up GitHub account
3. Deploy to Vercel

This takes about 30 minutes and you'll have a live website.

Then, on your tablet, you can simply:
- Visit the website URL in your browser
- The web app works perfectly on tablets!

================================================================================
OPTION 2: USE YOUR TABLET (ADVANCED)
================================================================================

If you really want to use your tablet, here are your options:

A) USE GITHUB WEBSITE (Web Browser)
------------------------------------
1. Download a file manager app on your tablet
2. Create a folder for your project
3. Use GitHub.com website to:
   - Create a new repository
   - Upload files manually through the web interface
   - Click "Upload files" button

   This is slow but works.

B) USE CODE EDITOR ON TABLET
------------------------------
Apps available:
- Acode (Android) - free code editor
- Code Editor (iOS) - paid
- Replit.com (web-based) - free, works in browser

These let you edit code on tablet, but deployment is still complicated.

C) USE CLOUD CODING PLATFORM
------------------------------
EASIEST FOR TABLETS:

1. Replit.com (Free)
   - Works in any browser
   - You can paste all your files
   - Built-in terminal
   - One-click deployment to web
   - FREE
